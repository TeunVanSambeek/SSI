# SSI
Self Sovereign Identity (on Blockstack platform)
This is an app where people can establish their own Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) without the 'help' of centralized institutes like banks, governments or phone-companies. People can fully create their unambiguous ID-Card themselves. The ID-Card shows your name and features like color of hair, color of eyes, length, blood type, gender, special features like scars and pictures of your face, iris and fingerprints and - if available - a DNA sequence. This ID-Card is then Hashed, using the SHA256 algorithm to generate the regarding ID-Code. This ID-Code can then be distributed to family and friends and used on various environments like school or work to produce a "mountain" of proof that the ID-Card is unique to this person. Because it is not possible to create a single, unbambiguous identity in the encrypted evnironment that is being created, our Self-Sovereign Identity system, is necessary for creating a decentralized society where people can prove that their achievements are really theirs and where social security can be safely distributed to each SINGLE person that is entitled to it.

The ID-Card can already be generated on www.ubi-coin.com. On Blockstack we will create the software that stores ID-Codes and ID-Cards of friends and family, which is an important process to generate the 'mountain of proof' that is used to make sure there is only one ID-Card being used for every person that has an ID-Card.
